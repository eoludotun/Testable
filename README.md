Test Automation FrameWork Tools  (Maven - BDD) for Testing UI base Application

If you need to run the test, You actually don't need an IDE... you can just goto CMD .-> cd into the folder that you checkout this code into, then run  below command

mvn test -P Non-Parallel-Tests -Dcucumber.options="-t @smoketest"

But if you want to use an IDE, then you can download Eclipse, here https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
